Nowadays, ticket scams and ticket sales are commonly related, which is a pro- blem because it leads to a lack of trust on the part of customers. These scams consist of duplicate tickets that are sold as copies of the original through multi- vendor services or the exchange between individuals. Commonly this is spread on social networks, when the owner of the ticket cannot attend the event since it is the fastest way of communication. This project proposes the solution to the aforementioned problem by analyzing and developing a decentralized platform that will allow users to obtain a unique token in the form of a ticket. This token will authenticate the purchase of the token and give them access to the event. The platform also offers users to resell previously purchased tickets in case of not being able to attend, when this action is performed the ticket will be transfe- rred from one user to another leaving at all times a record in Blockchain about who is the owner.

The application demonstrates how two completely different users interact with the platform, and we will showcase several different scenarios.

In the first scenario, we will observe how a user accesses the 'safeTicket' platform by authenticating with MetaMask. This user already purchased a ticket for a past concert they attended but now wants to buy a new one. They will access the main menu and purchase a Platinum ticket for Vampire Weekend, where they can view all the attributes associated with this ticket. Once satisfied, they will proceed to the payment screen, where the final price will be displayed. After purchasing the ticket, it will automatically appear in their profile.

Next, we will examine a scenario where the same user cannot attend the event and wants to resell their ticket. In their profile, they will select the ticket they wish to sell (in this case, the Vampire Weekend ticket). The user will have two options: validate the ticket (which is unavailable until 30 minutes before the event) or sell the ticket. In this case, the user will sell the ticket by setting the price they want and confirming the sale. They will then wait for someone to purchase the ticket.

In the third scenario, a completely different user is looking to purchase a resale ticket. This user will also access the platform through MetaMask and navigate to the resale section since tickets for Vampire Weekend are sold out. Here, they will select the ticket they wish to purchase, and all the information about the current owner will be displayed. Once satisfied, the user will proceed to payment, confirm the purchase, and upon completion, the ownership of the ticket will be transferred securely from one user to another.

Lastly, we will observe a scenario where the previous user (Maritere) wants to validate their ticket to attend the concert. They will select the ticket and proceed to sign a message, generating a digital signature that can be verified by the service without knowing the private key. This process ensures that the user is the real owner of the NFT.
